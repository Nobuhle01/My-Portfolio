      <p>I’m Nobuhle a creative and dedicated Full Stack Software/Web Developer with a passion for building applications that are both functional and beautiful. I enjoy working across the full development stack—from designing intuitive frontends to developing powerful backend systems.

I thrive in collaborative environments and love turning complex challenges into elegant solutions. Whether it's developing a custom dashboard, an e-commerce site, or an appointment booking system, I focus on delivering clean, efficient code and seamless user experiences.

When I'm not coding I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and refining my skills through continuous learning.

Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
